# Virtual OS for people with impaired vision
This project
aims at building a platform for the visually impaired people which has all essential features and they are easily accessible with help of a virtual assistant.
The Virtual Assistant basically converts Speech-to-Text and thus makes the
web-app more accessible for people with low vision. According to a research,
contrasting color combinations have a greater visibility for the visually impaired people and hence the User Interface is designed using contrasting color
combinations.
We built a web-app which has various features for the Visually Impaired.
The web-app has all essential features such as:
1. Virtual Assistant
2. Email
3. Memo
4. Contacts
5. Entertainment (Sudoku)
6. Timer
